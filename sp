ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.—The Sandia Peak Ski Area has put its opening on hold for now.

The ski area was set to open Dec. 22, but wintry weather has yet to bring much-needed snow to the slopes.

Sandia Peak officials say they are hopeful that forecasted weather will bring snow in the coming weeks, but until then the official opening is delayed.
